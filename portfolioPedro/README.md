3. **Skills**: Explore the technologies and skills I have worked with over time.
4. **Work**: View some of the projects that highlight my capabilities.

## Features

- **API Integration**: The portfolio features real-time Montreal weather at the bottom, keeping it dynamic and relevant.
- **Navigation Icons**: On the left side of the page, you'll find icons leading to my main online profiles - LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, and my CV.

## Challenges Faced

1. **API Implementation and Customization**: I tried to implement a NASA picture of the day API on my portfolio but was facing
a some problems with it, mainly when trying to balance it with the general UI.

2. **Web Hosting with React**: Hosting a React app came with some problems too. I was in contact with the support which
helped me solving the issues.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: I'm currently working on the CI/CD pipeline. The process hit some problems, but I'm working on resolving the problems.
